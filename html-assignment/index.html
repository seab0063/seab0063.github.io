            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born on July 21<sup>st</sup>, 2002, in Ottawa and have lived there for my whole life. I
            have always been a huge fan of Nintendo and the Super Mario franchise. I enjoy watching good comedy
            shows on TV, examples being <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Family Guy</em> and <em>The Office</em>.
            I am also into watching hockey. I'm a Hurricanes fan but I cheer for the Dallas Stars as well.</p>
            <p>I have taken a bunch of media arts courses while I attended <em>Hillcrest High School</em>,
            and have always enjoyed that stuff and got good grades in those classes, so that is why I 
            decided to go into the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. I am looking
            forward to learning more this semester.</p>
