      <p>Yoshis (referred to as Yoshisaurs in the Super Mario World cartoon, and alternatively pluralized
        "Yoshies" in the original Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island) are a sapient species of omnivorous
        dinosaur that first appeared in Super Mario World. They later starred in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's
        Island, Yoshi's Story, Yoshi Touch & Go, Yoshi's Island DS, Yoshi's New Island, Yoshi's Woolly World,
        and Yoshi's Crafted World. The name is derived from the Japanese interjection "yoshi" (よし), meaning
        "great". The most well-known Yoshi is simply named Yoshi and is an ally of Mario, often aiding Mario
        or being a protagonist of his own adventures. Yoshis are characterized primarily by their production
        and use of eggs as offensive tools. Yoshis can spontaneously lay hollow eggs after eating other
        animals or fruit, and then use them as projectile weaponry; other eggs have been shown to hatch into
        items, and some eggs hatch into baby Yoshis. In some games, such as the Super Smash Bros. series,
        Yoshi is able to turn himself into an egg to either protect himself or to roll into others as an
        attack. Yoshis come in a variety of colors, although green is the most common. Yoshis are most closely
        associated with Yoshi's Island; however, they are a widespread species, found on a number of islands,
        such as Lavalava Island and Isle Delfino, as well as the continental Mushroom Kingdom and the neighboring
        Beanbean Kingdom.</p>
